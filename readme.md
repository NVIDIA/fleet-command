# NVIDIA Fleet Command 

## Introduction 
NVIDIA Fleet Command is a hybrid-cloud platform for securely and remotely deploying, managing, and scaling AI across dozens or up to thousands of servers or edge devices. Instead of spending weeks planning and executing deployments, administrators can in minutes scale AI to retail stores, warehouses, hospitals, or city street intersections. With the capability of an entire IT division in a single control plane, administrators can manage the lifecycle of AI applications, update system software over the air, and remotely monitor and access systems.
